Do NOT look into llvm-project dir, it's LLVM submodule, is too huge for your context window and is irreleant for what we are doing. It matches public llvm repo anyway. Don't look into that dir.


Assume that GCC, libgcc and friends is not available, will never be available, and must not be used for any purpose.
